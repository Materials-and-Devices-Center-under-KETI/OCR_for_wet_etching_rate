# Measurement of Wet Etching Rate
This program was developed based on our dear operator Mr. J. Yoon's requests and aims to streamline the measurement of the wet etching rate of semiconductor samples.

<div align="justify"> 
This program operates on top of the etch rate measurement application and is designed to position itself over the area where the measurement data are logged as in Fig. 1. It first saves the area as an image file (.PNG) as a backup, read the figures with the optical character recognition engine Tesseract, and save them in an Excel file (.CSV).
