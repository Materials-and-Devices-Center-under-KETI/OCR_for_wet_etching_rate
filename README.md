# Measurement of Wet Etching Rate
**&lt;ABSTRACT&gt;**
<div align="justify"> 
This program operates on top of an etch rate measurement application. It saves the area containing the measured values as an image file (.PNG), 
then uses the optical character recognition engine Tesseract to read the data and generate an Excel file (.CSV). 
The program is designed to position itself over the area where the measurement data is read when executed.
